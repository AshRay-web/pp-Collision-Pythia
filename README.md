Hereâ€™s a draft for your README file for this project:
Proton-Proton Collision Simulation and Analysis

This repository contains a project utilizing PYTHIA and ROOT for simulating proton-proton collisions, storing collision data, and analyzing the results. The project also includes a Python script for visualizing the data.
Project Overview

    Collision Simulation with PYTHIA and ROOT
        Tool: PYTHIA (event generator) integrated with ROOT.
        Process: Simulates proton-proton collisions.
        Data Stored: Momentum components (x, y, z), particle IDs, and sizes of final-state particles.
        Output: Data saved in a ROOT file for further analysis.

    Data Analysis with Python
        Functionality: Reads the ROOT file and analyzes the particle data.
        Visualization: Generates a pie chart to represent the types and proportions of particles produced during the collisions.
        Focus: Includes only final-state particles in the analysis.
        



    Multithreaded Simulation
        Optimization: The program is designed to run in multithreaded mode, significantly speeding up the simulation process.

Features

    High-performance simulation using multithreading.
    Data persistence via ROOT files for easy storage and retrieval.
    User-friendly visualization of particle production.

Using Pythia for simulation and ROOT for Analysis. I have learned about proton-proton collision at 8 TeV. 



Again, I am using CHATGPT for writing this readme file because I am tired and It does a better job at writing than I do. Just enjoy, use AI for the work you feel lazy.
